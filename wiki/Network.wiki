#summary networking info for robot

= IP Addresses =

The robot network uses static ip addresses. No dhcp server is running on the wireless bridge.

Replace x.y with your team number. So for our team it would be 28.76
  * 10.x.y.1 Wireless Bridge on Robot
  * 10.x.y.2 CRIO
  * 10.x.y.3 Reserved
  * 10.x.y.4 Wireless Router
  * 10.x.y.5 Driver Station/Classmate
  * 10.x.y.11 Camera

Any other address on the 10.x.y.z network can be used for laptops. For example:
  * 10.x.y.6 Development System

= Wireless vs Wired =
You can connect a laptop directly to the wireless bridge using an ethernet cable if wireless isn't working.  Be sure to set the 'wired internet connection' on your laptop to use an ip address different than the wireless one.

You can connect a laptop directly to the CRIO but you have to use a cross-over ethernet cable.  Usually you only need to do this if imaging the crio with new firmware.
